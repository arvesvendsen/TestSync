# TestSync
I was asked to reserach a way to keep to Git repositories in sync. One in
GitHub and one in Azure DevOps.  Both repositories require pull requests.

Settings for the repo on GitHub includes:
* Allow anyone to contribute (not just collaborators)
* Require pull requests, with the exception for Administrators
